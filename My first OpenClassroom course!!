# my first OpenClassroom course!!

  Hey everyone, today i've just finished my first OpenClassroom course about AI on https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/6417031-objectif-ia-initiez-vous-a-lintelligence-artificielle. It was an initiation as the idea of machine learning (ML), deep learning, and even big data weren't very clear in my mind
the course was estimated 6h but i spent around 2h (twice 1h). there I learned many specifics words such as "data minning" for example, which is a method used to select the useful ideas among others (is it?).
the first thing i remember about and consider as the most improtant : the 6 steps of a conceptions of any AI. collection (of data) ; cleaning (removing useless data, aberrants one..) ; exploration (of data) ; modeling (choose the right model = mathematical formula) ; evaluate (make tests of your AI on un=known data) ; deploy on the market!
if there's several way to teach to a algoryhtm. Say we want to learn him to differenciate a bottle to  a pen. Supervisoring (providing photos of both bottle and pen and labeling them so the algorythm learn the defference through millions of exmaples); non-supervisoring (don't provide the label so the machine create categories itself) and the try/error (the algorythm try alone to find solution little by little) three are different method of machine learning.
An branch of ML is the deep learning (DL) it's inspired of the structure of our super brain. using artificial neurons. How it works? when porvinding a photo. several couch of neuron would successively receive and work on every pixel. of course, at first, the algorythm would answer something at random, and overtime, the  efficiency of connection between neurons modify (as braincells) to adapt. because the DL is very specific, we also use the Convolutional neutral netwirk (CNN) that's used to philtrer the image. in effect, training your AI only with photos of people in the foreground won't allow it to recognise anyone in the background.

Remember, all this information are the result of what i've learned from the course, therefore, some could be inacurrate. If you are a specialist of AI, feel free to correct me!!
